TICTACTOE
    This code creates an all time classic game of tictactoe with a grafical user interface but it is with a twist. 
    The game size is dynamic so you can choose by yourself the size of the gameboard and the amount of marks needed to win.
    This was a school project and was created in my first year as a student and a coder.
